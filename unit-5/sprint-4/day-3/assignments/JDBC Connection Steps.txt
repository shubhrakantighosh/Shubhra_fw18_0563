JDBC Connection :

 Step 1: We have to create a class and declare the main function.
 Step 2: In that main function we have to set our Driver 1st but after Java 1.8 we don't have to define 
but it's recommended to be defined otherwise it's it will work the normal way.
 Step 3: We have to set our URL.
 Step 4: The last step is we have to check the connection it's getting connected or using DriverManager.   

Here is an example :

package com.masai;

import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

import com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver;

public class JDBCConnection {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		
		try {
			Driver driver=new Driver();
		} catch (SQLException e) {

			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
		String url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db1";
		
		try (Connection connection=DriverManager.getConnection(url,"root","root")){
			
			System.out.println("It's connected to Database db1");
			
		} catch (SQLException e) {

			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		
	}

}
