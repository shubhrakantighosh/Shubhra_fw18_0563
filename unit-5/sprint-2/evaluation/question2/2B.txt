(Q) Write a program that will result in a deadlock. How will you fix deadlock in Java show with
examples?

Answers-> In our Java deadlock two or more threads are waiting but if we try to get a result if the speel for 5 seconds so the second 
the thread also executes at the same time so basically so we will get output at the same same time to fix this issue we can use 
synchronized. So when the 1st thread going for executing the 2nd oner it is waiting for him up to the 1st execution. When the 1st is done
completely the second going to execute Basically they are waiting in a queue. But there is a problem there it doesn't necessary 1st one 
is going for executing the 1st  it can be 2nd.
