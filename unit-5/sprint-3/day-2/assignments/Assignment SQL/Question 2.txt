Primary Key :-> 

( a ) Primary Key is a unique key we can't create or make using its value.
( b ) It should be Unique.
( c ) It should be null.
( d) To create a Primary key using table - create table abc ( id int, name varchar( 3 ), primary key ( id ) );

Unique Key :->
( a ) Unique keys help us to maintain the same things in a different table. for example on a table 
we store students' names and id on a table and on another table we store students' addresses, and phone numbers. 
To justify in the same table we use Unique Key.
( b ) It can be null. This means it can store null values.
( c ) it can be duplicated.
