ON A WINDY WINTER MORNING, A WOMAN LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW.THE ONLY THING SHE SAW, A GARDEN. A SMILE SPREAD ACROSS HER FACE AS SHE SPOTTED MARIA, 
HER DAUGHTER, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN ENJOYING THE WEATHER. IT STARTED DRIZZLING. MARIA STARTED DANCING JOYFULLY.SHE TRIED TO WAVE TO HER DAUGHTER, 
BUT HER ELBOW WAS STUCK, HER ARM HURT, HER SMILE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. REALITY CAME CRASHING DOWN AS THE DRIZZLE TURNED INTO A STORM. 
MARIA'S MURDERED CORPSE CONSUMED HER MIND.ON A WINDY WINTER MORNING, A WOMAN LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW OF HER JAIL CELL.
