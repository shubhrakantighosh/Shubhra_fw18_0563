Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?
Answer: In java Overloading methods means we are using the same function name but parameters are the difference 
that case we used to call overloading.
For an Example:

public class Overloading {
    public void fun(int number){
        System.out.println(number);
    }
    public void fun(String name){
        System.out.println(name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Overloading parameter=new Overloading();
        parameter.fun(5);
        parameter.fun("shubhra");
    }
}
 
In this case, the parameter is different but the name of the function is the same compiler understands which function depending on the parameter it's going to execute
that parameter is passing the data to that particular function.

 
And in the other case Overriding means, the function name and the parameter are also the same its called overriding. the meaning of the word override means it overrides 
the new one so basically in our Java programing it works the same as if we won't do some changes to that particular function without changing his name or changing
 his whole thing What we can do is we can create a function using his same whatever the thing which we will add this function before declaring the function n we just 
simply type "Overriding " is gonna override that thing. That's all about overriding function.
