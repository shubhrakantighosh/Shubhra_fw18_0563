Q1) Differentiate between JRE,JVM and JDK?

Answer: The full of the JRE, JVM and JDK are JRE(Java Runtime Environment), JVM(Java Virtual Machine), and JDK(Java Development Kit).

JRE helps us convert that .java file to .class means converting to a byte code. That byte code file can read any operating system like Windows, Mac, Linux, Ubuntu etc.
For Example: In the windows operating system if we convert the file .class menas byte code. and if we share the .class file with any operating like Mac that
 the system can easily readable.

JVM is the virtual machine of java. We can run that file in our operating system by using any Intellij like that kind of software in our command.

JDK is a development kit of java that helps us run the file in our computer system.
For Example Intellij etc.
