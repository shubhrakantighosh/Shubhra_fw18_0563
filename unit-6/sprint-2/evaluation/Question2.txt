Explain the difference between JPA and Hibernate, and What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?

If we talk about JDBC vs Hibernate both are working the same but the main problem is using JDBC to do all the operations it’s
 a very hepatic process for day-to-day life work. To enhance performance, ace and reduce code here is come hibernate. Using 
hibernate our day-to-day life easier. We can do a 10plus table using pieces of the line of code. That is the advantage and the 
main thing is we don’t have to remember all those syntaxes For MYSQL and SQLite etc. we can do that thing using our coding 
language. That’s all about the advantages of using hibernate.

JPA is the query language we use to get particular data from the database. If we talk about MySQL queries and JPA queries
 mostly quite small. That’s all about JPA.
