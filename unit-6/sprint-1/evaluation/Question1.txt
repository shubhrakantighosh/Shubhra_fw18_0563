Advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC: Basically, both work the same but due to the hepatic process we use Hibernate. 
In JDBC each project we have to add a jar file, and we have to write SQL queries it doesn’t matter how long the SQL queries
 are and if you talk about 10 plus tables, we have to write so many lines. But by using Hibernate Day to day life becomes easier 
we don’t have to add any jar file we just have to add source code in the pom.xml file. And it is faster than JDBC. And also, we don’t 
have to remember or practice those SQL or MySQL or SQLite Syntaxes. Using our java syntax, we can same thing. So those are some 
points that will prove what is the advantage of using Hibernate.
