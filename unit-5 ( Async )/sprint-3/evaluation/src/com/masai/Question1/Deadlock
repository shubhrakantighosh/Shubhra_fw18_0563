Deadlock: 

A deadlock is a state where two or more states waiting for each other. 
If we extend the Thread class or implement Runnable, the run class will
 be overridden when we try to start those methods, it going to be printed 
 one by one simultaneously. But if we use synchronized it going to wait 
 for the queue stage where each of us is going to wait for each other. 
 Thatâ€™s all about.
