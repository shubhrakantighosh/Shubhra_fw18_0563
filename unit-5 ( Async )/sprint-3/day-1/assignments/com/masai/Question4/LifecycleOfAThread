States of a thread or lifecycle of a thread:
There are five states is there is a thread.
(i)	    New State. (So, the new state is like “Thread thread=new Thread (constructor of the class)”. It is an initialized state. );
(ii)	Runnable state. (When we do “thread.start()” . it will run.)
(iii)	Blocked state.( Blocked states like when doing some performance on that particular thread like sleep, wait, join.)
(iv)	Running state.( With the help of thread scheduler, its scheduling.)
(v)	    Dead state.( When it completes all the tasks.)
