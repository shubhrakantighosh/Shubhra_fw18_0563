Difference between call Java run() method vs start() method :

If we call the run() method so will call like the normal method we used
 to call. so, it wonâ€™t come work 2 or more different threads at the same time.
But if we call the start() method so 1st it will do some thread scheduling 
operations and it will work parallel with other threads.
