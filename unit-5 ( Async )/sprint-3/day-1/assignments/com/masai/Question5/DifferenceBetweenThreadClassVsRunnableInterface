Difference between Thread class vs Runnable interface:

Using thread: Suppose we are extending another class with thread. 
So, here to get thread functionality we have to override the run method. 
Then in the run method, we can do tasks whatever we want. form the main class
we just create a constructor of the particular class and after creating the 
Object of the class we just simply do the class name. start() so it will execute
all the tasks.But the main problem is once expanding the thread class we cannot 
extend another which is very dis advantage is there. So instead of using Thread, 
we can use the Runnable interface so it will also work in the same manner and 
the good thing is we can extend another class as well. That is the main benefit of 
using the Runnable interface.

Sodo Code of Thread class:

class Thread implements Runnable{
	@Override
	public void run() {	
	}
	public void start(){
		run();
	}
}
