Multithreading:

Multithreading is a process which it can run simultaneously run multiple threads 
at the same time. For example, we want to do some tasks using our applications,
but we don’t have that much time. The problem is it will execute one by one. So,
It will take so much time for this but here using thread we have a couple of 
advantages is there like it every thread is independent so will run, it doesn’t
wait for another thread will complete its work. it also takes low memory space 
like it can share their memory. and the good thing is if an Exception occurs, 
it can handle it. It will doesn’t affect another thread. That’s all about.

The important part is ->

(i)	    It will take less time to execute because all threads are working simultaneously.
(ii)	It shared memory, so it is lightweight.
(iii)	If any thread exceptions occur it can handle it. It won’t affect another thread.
