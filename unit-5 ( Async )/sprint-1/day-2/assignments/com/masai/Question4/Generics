In our java suppose we create an application where only student class objects going to add if I didn’t 
Declared any generics it and hold anything like single integer, string, double, teacher class object, null etc.
Now the problem is if we try to find the name of the student whose height marks in his class, we will get ClassCastException
 because it’s not going to sort according to our needs. So, it’s always recommended to add generics. Generics give us Type Safety.
That’s all about.
